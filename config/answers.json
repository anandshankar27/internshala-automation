    "1" : "I should be hired for this internship because I have a good knowledge of all the tech stack required on this internship. I have been working on web development from one year so, I have spend a good time on it. I completed a full stack development internship last summer. I have worked on both server side and client side projects. I have also developed the website for my college festival. I am 3rd year B.Tech (Information Technology) student and want to enhance my knowledge and experience by doing an internship with a startup like yours. I have learned a lot from my previous internship and I wish to learn more from your company. I am willing to improve my skills and give my best at work.",
